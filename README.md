## Reflections

* It takes way more time than I expected. The main reason is that I spent decent amount of time in the pure CSS layout implementation. I also got expected issues e.g. finding free icons.
* External styling should be used when the project scaling.
* The tests can definately cover more after I'm more proficient in Vitest.
* No util dependencies used.
